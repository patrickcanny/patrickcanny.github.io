          <p> Writing down stuff I dream about. Most of this stuff is not feasible or practical, but I'm writing it down to inspire both myself as well as any travelers who stumble upon this page.</p>

              <a href="https://coloradotrail.org/">The Colorado Trail</a>
              <p>"Mile for mile the most beautiful trail in America." Doing this is a pretty personal goal for me, as it was the first long-distance hiking trail that I had ever heard of, and really what got me into backpacking and hiking again. I am increasingly becoming interested in starting in Durango for a NOBO thru-hike in early September. 486 miles.</p>

              <p>One of the most impressive mountain ranges I have ever seen, and I love that there is an opportunity to traverse the Great Sand Dunes instead of staying on the ridge proper. ~100 miles of difficult scrambling, this is a stretch.</p>

              <p>This is pretty much my dream hike, linking together all of the trails I want to see and all of the places I want to visit in the Southwest in one trip. I would likely do the packrafting alternates on the Hayduke, and try to find more ways to make this as unique and memorable a journey as possible. 1782 miles across Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, linking the Hayduke Trail, Arizona Trail, and Grand Enchantment Trail.</p>

              <p>6875 miles, this is probably something I'll never do, but it is the way to experience the west on foot. Also, at the time of writing this, only two people have ever completed it in under a year.</p>

              <p>95 mile high route with 65 miles of off-trail travel in Wyoming's Wind River Range. I currently have plans to do this route in late August 2020, given that it is logistically possible in the midst of COVID-19. Considering that it is an unsupported attempt, that I have done routes like this before and that the only outside contact will be with a pre-arranged ride from a cousin, I think the odds are good.</p>

              <p>Nate Bender is probably the most hardcore dude I've ever read about, and this route is probably the most gnarly thing possible. I really want to meet him and maybe do this one day...if the grizzlies don't get him first. The Beartooths are probably one of the wildest places in the US, and I'd love to visit someday.</p>
