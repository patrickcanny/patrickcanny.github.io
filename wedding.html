        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <ul class="">
          <li class="question">Q: What is the dress code?</li>
          <li>A: Please wear what you'll be comfortable in! We don't want to enforce a strict dress code. We are having
            a fall wedding, so fall colors (brown, maroon, yellow, dark green, etc) are preferred!</li>
          <li class="question">Q: What time will the ceremony be over?</li>
          <li>A: The ceremony will be 30-45 minutes, and we'll have a short reception at the venue right afterwards. We
            have the venue booked until 1pm, so we'll need to be out of the venue promptly before 1pm.</li>
          <li class="question">Q: Will there be a reception?</li>
          <li>A: There will be a short reception at the venue after the ceremony. We'll provide light refreshments, but
            not a full meal. Consider one of the many great dining options in Boulder for afterwards!</li>
          <li class="question">Q: Are there any other events around the wedding?</li>
          <li>A: Yes! Please refer <a href="./family-events.html">here</a> if you are a family member, and <a
              href="friend-events.html">here</a> if you are a
            friend of the couple. If you
            can't make it to an event, no problem.</li>
          <li class="question">Q: What are some of the details about the venue?</li>
          <li>A: Sunrise Ampitheater is an outdoor wedding venue with built-in seating that is on Flagstaff mountain.
            There isn't much shade, but there is plenty of seating. There is a restroom near the venue, and parking
            available in several lots. Parking is limited, so please consider carpooling for this reason! You can read a
            little more and see some photos at <a
