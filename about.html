        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Patrick, and I'm a Software Engineer who mostly uses Vue.js. Thanks for visiting my
          site!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have been working professionally on developing performant web applications for smart TVs for roughly 2.5
          years now. In that time, I have worked with both Vue and React.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While I'm not working, I like to plan and hike interesting
          routes in the mountain west, play disc golf, and listen to records with my friends. I'm also a professional
          yoyo player currently ranked 7th in the world.
