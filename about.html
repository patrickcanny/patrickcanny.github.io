        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Patrick. Thanks so much for visiting my website!
        </p>
        <p>
          I work professionally as a software engineer developing both front and back end technologies. I have a varied
          skillset, and believe in using the best technologies to solve the specific problems being faced.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I'm not working, I like to plan and hike interesting
          routes in the mountain west, play disc golf, and listen to records with my friends. I'm also a professional
          yoyo player currently ranked 7th in the world.
        </p>
        <p>On my website, you will find photos, videos, text and other things that interest me enough to share here. I
          am
          excited to share the things I am interested in with whoever wants to give them a look, and I can only hope
          that something I put into the world is helpful for someone else. Hopefully you can find things that are
          helpful for you!</p>
        <p>Best wishes, and safe travels on your journeys :)</p>
