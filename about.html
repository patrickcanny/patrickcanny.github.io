                <strong> 
                    Hello! My name is Patrick, and I'm a Software Engineer with roughly 1.5 years of professional experience. I am currently based in Denver, CO. Thanks for checking out my website!
                </strong>
                <br><br>
                My primary interests include Software Engineering and DevOps, but I am also interested in fundamental computer science topics such as complexity theory, programming language paradigms and analysis of algorithms.
                <br><br>
                <strong>
                    In my free time, I love to hike, shoot photos, play board games and drink coffee. To me, there's nothing better than a lazy day with great friends!
                </strong>
                <br><br>
                In 2019, I accomplished two of my long term goals: graduating college, and placing top 10 in the world for competitive yoyo. I graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. I'm currently ranked #5 in the USA for yoyoing, and #7 in the world.

                <br><br>
                <strong>I am proficient with Python, JavaScript and C++, familiar with Java, Typescript, Haskell and C, and highly interested in gaining experience with Rust and Go.</strong>
                <br><br>
                    I have experience with a variety of modern technologies. I am proficient with Flask, React, Google Cloud Build and Unix-based OS. I am familiar with MySQL, MongoDB, Kubernetes, Docker, Django, Node.js and Google Cloud Platform.
