                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                <strong> I am a software engineer currently based in Denver, CO.</strong><br><br>
                My primary interests include Software Engineering and data science, but I've become more interested in fundamental CS concepts as of late. <br><br>
                <strong> I mostly use Python, Javascript, and C++, but I'm pretty good with Java, Haskell, and C. I'm wanting to learn Go and Rust.</strong><br><br>
                I have experience with a variety of technologies, including React, Flask, Django, Kubernetes, Docker, Unix-based OS, Vim, and Google Cloud Products<br><br>
                <strong>In my free time, I love to hike, shoot film photography,  and drink coffee. There's nothing better than a lazy day with great friends!</strong><br><br>
                In 2019, I accomplished two of my long term goals: graduating college, and placing top 10 in the world for competitive yoyo. I graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. I'm currently ranked #5 in the USA for yoyoing, and #7 in the world.
